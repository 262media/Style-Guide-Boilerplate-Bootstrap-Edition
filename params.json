Your site will have it's own unique patterns.*\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](http://www.monolinea.com/wp-content/uploads/Style_Guide_Boilerplate.png)\r\n\r\n## Getting Started With Style Guide Boilerplate\r\n\r\n### Download the Style Guide Boilerplate\r\nYou can clone, fork, or download the repo from GitHub.\r\nOnce you have the files for **Style Guide Boilerplate**, you'll create a directory on your site for them.\r\n\r\n### Set up your project name\r\nOpen the `index.php` file, and look for line 2, where it says:\r\n`$project_name = \"Project Name\";`\r\nPut your own project name between the quotation marks\r\n\r\n### Hook up your own CSS into the style guide\r\nIn the `<head>` of **Style Guide Boilerplate** are custom styles for the boilerplate itself. These have all been prefixed with sg- so they hopefully shouldn't cause any conflicts with your website's own styles.\r\n\r\nBelow the custom styles for the boilerplate, you will add in your own custom stylesheet(s) which you use on your live site.\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n    <!-- Replace below stylesheet with your own stylesheet -->\r\n  \t<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/theme.css\">\r\n  \t\r\n\r\n### Set up a directory on your site for the style guide\r\nI recommend creating a directory named `style-guide` in your site's root directory. I think it would be awesome if I could go to `anysite.com/style-guide/` and check out that site's style guide.\r\n\r\n### Upload the Style Guide Boilerplate files\r\n**Style Guide Boilerplate** is currently PHP based so you will need a server that supports PHP. Just upload the files from the GitHub repo to your newly created directory and your almost done.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n### Review your live site CSS\r\nYou should be able to go to `yoursite.com/style-guide/` and see how your live site's CSS affects base elements.\r\nThe last step is creating your sites custom patterns/modules.\r\n\r\n### Create custom documentation files\r\nYou can create an intro or other documentation files. Just create an html file with the contents, styled in html, and upload the file as `document-title.html` into the `docs` directory inside of your `style-guide` directory.\r\n\r\n### Configure foundation elements\r\nThe boilerplate comes, by default, with guides for **colors, typography**, and a visible bootstrap basic **grid**. You can edit these or add new ones for things such as textures, icons or imagery, also by creating an html file and uploading to the `foundation` dir.\r\n\r\n#### Setting up color swatches\r\nThe sample file comes with the bootstrap primary and brand colors pre-configured. But to include the ones in _your_ bootstrap theme, you can use the styleguide.less file included in this package. It is set up to import your bootstrap variables, and when compiled, will generate the appropriate swatches. Make sure the import path at the top of the file is correct before compiling. If you need more colors, feel free to add more classes to the .less file. \r\n\r\n#### Setting up font stacks\r\nThe boilerplate comes, likewise, with predefined classes for primary and secondary Bootstrap font-family declarations\r\n\r\n### Create custom base styles patterns\r\nThe boilerplate comes with many bootstrap elements built in, such as buttons, breadcrumbs, alert messages, etc., but you can customize them by adding, deleting or modifying the files within the `markup/` directory\r\nSave the file as `pattern-name.html` into the `markup/patterns` directory inside of your `style-guide` directory.\r\n\r\nYou should now be able to see the new patterns at `yoursite.com/style-guide/`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Licensing \r\n**Style Guide Boilerplate Bootstrap Edition** is licensed under the [MIT License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License)\r\n\r\n##Questions? Comments?\r\nThe guide was forked and is maintained by [Kemie Guaida] (http://www.monolinea.com/about). It is a work in progress. There's lots of things that need to be fixed and cleaned up, but it is  good enough in it's present state and can hopefully be useful.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions or suggestions, you can open an issue here at github, or ping me via twitter[@kemie](http://twitter.com/kemie)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Additional Resources\r\n [Original Style Guide Boilerplate](http://brettjankord.com/projects/style-guide-boilerplate/)\r\n \r\n [Bootstrap documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/css/)\r\n[Front-end Style Guides](http://24ways.org/2011/front-end-style-guides/)\r\n\r\n[Creating Style guides](http://alistapart.com/article/creating-style-guides)\r\n\r\n[Front-end Style Guide Roundup](https://gimmebar.com/collection/4ecd439c2f0aaad734000022/front-end-styleguides)\r\n\r\n[Future-Friendly Style Guides](https://speakerdeck.com/lukebrooker/future-friendly-style-guides)\r\n\r\n[HTML KickStart](http://www.99lime.com/elements/)\r\n\r\n[Oli.jp Style Guide](http://oli.jp/2011/style-guide/)\r\n\r\n[Jeremy Keith's Pattern Primer](http://adactio.com/journal/5028/)\r\n\r\n[Paul Robert Llyod's Style Guide](http://www.paulrobertlloyd.com/about/styleguide/)\r\n\r\n[Pears](http://pea.rs/)\r\n\r\n[Starbucks Style Guide](http://www.starbucks.com/static/reference/styleguide/)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-XXXXX-X","note":"Don't delete this file!
